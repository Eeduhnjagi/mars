                <p class="mt-1"><b>12.1</b>
                    You acknowledge and understand that there are risks involved in Transactions, including:
                    <br><br>
                    (a) the gearing or leverage involved in investing in Financial Products means that a small Initial Margin payment can potentially lead to large losses for you, including more than all of the Margin ever paid to the Authorizer;
                    <br><br>
                    (b) the geared nature of Transactions also means that acquiring and holding them can carry greater risks than directly investing in the Underlying Security which generally are not geared;
                    <br><br>
                    (c) a relatively small market movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you;
                    <br><br>
                    (d) over-the-counter Transactions are derivatives not made on any Exchange so might be considered to involve a greater risk than an exchange-traded derivative since there is no exchange market on which to Close Out an Open Position - you are only able to open and close your positions with us;
                    <br><br>
                    (e) Transactions relating to a non-US market or denominated in non-US currency will be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;
                    <br><br>
                    (f) it is possible to incur a loss if, after your acquisition of an investment, exchange rates change to your detriment, even if the price of the Underlying Security to which the Transaction relates remains unchanged;
                    <br><br>
                    (g) you may sustain a total loss of the Margin that you deposit with or pay to us to establish or maintain a position and if the market moves against you, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional Margin at short notice but if you fail to do so within the required time, your investment position may be liquidated at a loss to you and you will be liable for any remaining deficit in your Account;
                    <br><br>
                    (h) you will be deemed to have received a notice requiring the payment of more Margin, even if you are not contactable, or actually contacted, at the telephone, mail or email address you gave us or do not receive the messages we leave for you, if the notices are delivered to your nominated contact addresses;
                    <br><br>
                    (i) under some trading conditions it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position, such as (but not limited to) at times of rapid price movement if the price rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that trading in the underlying market is suspended or restricted;
                    <br><br>
                    (j) if you trade in denominated currencies other than the Account currency you may lose money or value of the investment due to exchange rate fluctuations and that these losses may be in addition to any losses on the value of the Underlying Security relevant to the Transactions;
                    <br><br>
                    (k) gapping, whereby a market price falls or rises without the opportunity to trade, can result in significant losses even when a stop loss has been put on because it may not be possible to transact at the nominated price if the market has gapped;
                    <br><br>
                    (l) in some circumstances the Underlying Security may be halted, suspended from trading or have their quotation for trading withdrawn from an exchange and these factors might affect the value of your Transaction relating to those Underlying Securities due to Switch exercising its discretion to determine the fair value of them;
                    <br><br>
                    (m) a market disruption may mean that you are unable to trade when desired, and you may suffer a loss as a result. Examples of disruption include the “crash” of a computer- based trading system, fire or other exchange emergency or a regulatory body could declare an undesirable situation has developed in a particular contract and suspend trading; and
                    <br><br>
                    (n) you may incur losses that are caused by matters outside our control for example, a regulatory authority exercising its powers during a market emergency may result in losses for the Client or a regulatory authority can suspend trading (for example in an Underlying Security) or alter the price at which a position is settled, which could also result in a loss to the Client.

                <p class="mt-1">
                    <b>15.1</b> You agree and acknowledge with each of the following:
                    <br><br>
                    (a) Margin Cover refers to the amount paid or payable to the Authorizer as Switch requires (to protect against your liabilities on Transactions) and which is credited to your Account. The minimum amount of the Margin Cover is determined by Switch in its absolute discretion.
                    <br><br>
                    (b) A Margin payment is the amount you pay the Authorizer for crediting your Account as Margin Cover.
                    <br><br>
                    (c) The time for your payment to maintain Margin Cover and to satisfy any Margin call is of the essence.
                    <br><br>
                    (d) You must maintain at least the amount of Margin Cover required by Switch whether or not Switch gives any notice to you to make those payments or you have actual notice of the required amount. The required amount of Margin Cover can change continuously and can change automatically, including over the weekend or other non- trading days. Your obligation to maintain at least the required amount of Margin Cover is continuous.
                    <br><br>
                    (e) You must ensure that for so long that you have an Open Position, the Free Margin must always remain positive. If not, you may receive and have to satisfy a Margin call in accordance with these Terms.
                    <br><br>
                    (f) You have an obligation to satisfy a Margin call (in addition to your obligation to maintain Margin Cover) within the required time by any combination of Closing Out positions or making payments (or both) as accepted by Switch, in its absolute discretion. The payments to be made towards satisfying a Margin call must be made to the Trust Account held by the Authorizer. Margin calls may be made by any means of notice permitted by these Terms, including by telephone call to you or your Authorized Person or by way of the Online Service (even if you do not access your Account during the time the Margin call requires payment). You acknowledge that it is fundamental that you remain contactable by Switch at all times by Switch using the contact details you give Switch from time to time and that your failure to be contactable or to receive notice of a Margin call at any contact address you give does not affect the validity of the Margin call or your obligation to satisfy it.
                    <br><br>
                    (g) If no other time is stipulated by Switch for when you must satisfy the Margin call then you must comply within 24 hours of the Margin call being made, even if you have not received it or are actually aware of it and even if the time of making the Margin call or the time for satisfying it are outside of normal working hours of a Business Day. You acknowledge that Margin calls may be payable immediately if required by Switch.
                    <br><br>
                    (h) If you fail to satisfy the Margin call by the required time, then Switch may (without prejudice to any other rights or powers under these Terms) in its absolute discretion, and without creating an obligation to do so, Close Out, without notice, all or some of your Transactions, whether or not those Transactions caused the need for more Margin Cover.
                    <br><br>
                    (i) Your obligations to maintain Margin Cover and to satisfy Margin calls arise at the time the Transaction is executed irrespective of the time any later Margin call is made.
                    <br><br>
                    (j) It is solely your responsibility to monitor and to satisfy all Margin Cover and Margin call obligations, whether or not a Margin call is notified to you.
                    <br><br>
                    (k) A Margin payment is credited by Switch at the time cleared funds have been received into the Trust Account held by the Authorizer or such earlier time as allowed by Switch, so a Margin Cover requirement or a Margin call for a Contract for Difference or other OTC Transaction issued by Switch on behalf of the Authorizer is not satisfied unless and until your payment is received in cleared funds into the Trust Account.
                    <br><br>
                    (l) Without limiting any other right of the Authorizer, in respect of any Financial Product issued to you by Switch on behalf of the Authorizer, you authorize and direct, by these Terms, that all of the funds which you deposit into the Trust Account be immediately withdrawn by the Authorizer and paid to the Authorizer for its own account, towards satisfying your obligations to pay Transaction Fees, Finance Charges, to maintain Margin Cover, to meet Margin calls, and to pay all other amounts owing under these Terms, even if:
                    <br><br>
                    (i) your payment (after deduction for Transaction Fees, Finance Charges and other amounts owing) is in an amount less than or more than the amount required to satisfy a Margin call or to maintain the total amount of required Margin Cover;
                    <br>
                    (ii) more than one Margin call is made after your payment to a Trust Account;
                    <br>
                    (iii) the required amount of Margin Cover reduces after your payment to a Trust Account;
                    <br>
                    (iv) there is any delay between the time you make the payment to the Trust Account and when the Authorizer makes the withdrawal;
                    <br>
                    (v) you purport to withdraw your authority and direction, but you still have at that time an obligation to Switch to maintain an amount of Margin Cover or to satisfy a Margin call which has not been satisfied; or
                    <br>
                    (vi) you do not tell us your intended use of the Margin Cover which will be directed to your Account after your payment or you change your mind after you tell us and you deal in Financial Products for a lesser value than you told us or you do not deal.
                    <br><br>
                    (m) Your liability in respect of Margin requirements is not limited to the amount, if any, initially paid to the Authorizer for your Account. You are responsible to pay in cash any deficit owing to the Authorizer after Close Out of a Transaction and if you default in payment of such deficit, the Authorizer may pay the deficit out of the Account or the Authorizer may realize any Financial Products held by the Authorizer and apply the amounts or proceeds against that deficit and you are responsible for the full and prompt discharge of the deficit (which exceeds the value of the Account) by making payment in full to the Authorizer immediately when that deficit arises.
                    <br><br>
                    (n) Where money is held in an account that is inactive for at least 6 years, and the Authorizer is unable to locate you, the money will lodged with the New South Wales Office of State Revenue, where you may make a claim to retrieve it.

                    <br>
                    (c) at any time, and from time to time, the Authorizer determines that the value of all of your Open Positions (and not taking into account any cash balance in your Account) represents a substantial net unrealized loss to you such that, in the Authorizer's belief, the continued trading, or failure to Close Out, one or more of your Open Positions will or is likely to materially prejudice your Account Value.

                    <br>
                    (i) the rate at which you may enter a Position and the Initial Margin required by nominating the amount; or

                    4.2 Switch will from time to time state the prices or values at which the Authorizer may enter into a Contract for Difference Transaction with you, either to open or to Close Out a Contract for Difference. If you wish to enter into a Contract for Difference Transaction you may submit an Order to Switch (including by Online Service). The Authorizer is not bound to enter into any Contract for Difference Transaction with you and reserves the right to state another price or value at which it may deal with you.
                    <br><br>
                    (a) You may request on any given Business Day Switch to quote a price at which the Authorizer may be prepared to enter into a Contract for Difference. You agree to and acknowledge that a price quotation pursuant to this request does not constitute an offer to enter into a new or close an existing Contract for Difference.
                    <br><br>
                    (b) Upon receiving the quote from Switch, you may offer to enter into a Contract for Difference with the Authorizer at the price quoted by Switch.
                    <br><br>
                    (c) Switch is not obliged to accept your offer to enter into a Contract for Difference and, without limitation, is not obliged to accept your offer to enter into a Contract for Difference:

                    (i) if you have exceeded or would exceed a pre-determined limit imposed on you under clause 4.2(g) below; or<br>
                    (ii) until Switch has confirmed receipt from the Authorizer of the Initial Margin required in the form of cleared funds to enter into the respective Contract for Difference.
                    <br>
                    (d) The Initial Margin required to enter into a Contract for Difference, if not already received from you, will be payable to the Authorizer upon acceptance by Switch of your offer to enter into the Contract for Difference.
                    <br>
                    (e) If Switch accepts your offer to enter into a Contract for Difference, we will issue to you an electronic Confirmation of the Contract for Difference entered into shortly after it has been entered into. Failure by Switch to issue a Confirmation will not prejudice or affect the relevant Contract for Difference. The Authorizer will not bear any liability whatever resulting from the failure by Switch to issue a Confirmation. Switch will promptly advise you if Switch decides not to accept your offer to enter into a Contract for Difference.
                    <br>
                    (f) You agree to examine the terms of each Confirmation immediately upon receipt and you agree that the contents of the Confirmation, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive evidence of the executed deal, unless within 48 hours of issue of a written Confirmation you notify Switch of any disputed detail in the Confirmation received by you. Upon receipt of written notice within 48 hours of a disputed Transaction, the Authorizer will investigate the dispute and in co-operation with you must endeavor to resolve the dispute in good faith. Notwithstanding any such dispute, you must continue to satisfy your obligations to maintain Margin Cover and to pay Margin calls made by Switch in respect of the Contract for Difference as if the Confirmation was correct and the details contained in the Confirmation were not the subject of dispute.
                    <br>
                    (g) In its absolute discretion, Switch may limit the value of Contracts for Difference you may have outstanding under these Terms. If you wish to enter into any further Contracts for Difference, you must seek and obtain approval from Switch, beyond which you may not enter into any further Synthetic Equities whatever.
                    <br>
                    (h) Switch may vary the limit imposed at any time in its absolute discretion.

                    <br>
                    (b) If the Contract Value determined by Switch in accordance with clause 5(a) above is higher than the Contract Value determined by Switch in respect of the previous Close of Business, then the Short Party must pay to the Long Party the difference.

                    (e) If Switch determines that the Contract Value of a Contract for Difference at Close of Business cannot be determined in accordance with clause 5(a) above for any reason, the Contract Value at Close of Business will be the value determined by Switch in its sole discretion.

                    (a) If you are the Long Party to a Contract for Difference, and the issuer of the Reference Asset makes a cash distribution in respect of the Reference Asset (for example, a dividend in respect of a Reference Asset which is a security), the Authorizer will credit to your Account in respect of the Contract for Difference an equivalent amount (less any Taxes and costs) within a reasonable period following the date the cash distribution is paid in respect of the Reference Asset corresponding with your Contract for Difference being the amount that will be equal to the cash dividend payable to the holder of the Underlying Security multiplied by the quantity on the first Business Day following the ex-dividend date for the Underlying Security. The Authorizer is not obliged to pay to you any amount under this clause (a) unless and until it receives that amount as the owner of the Reference Asset or an equivalent amount under the Hedge Contract acquired in respect of the Contract for Difference. Further, the Authorizer is not liable to pay to you any amount in excess of the amount (less any Taxes and costs) which the Authorizer itself receives either as the owner of the Reference Asset or pursuant to a Hedge Contract acquired in respect of the Contract for Difference.

                    <b>7. Closing out a Contract for Difference</b>
                    <br><br>
                    (a) At any time, you may give Switch notice of your intention to close any Contract for Difference (whether in whole or part) by specifying the Underlying Security and the quantity of Contracts for Difference that you wish to close.
                    <br>
                    (b) Upon receipt of notice of intent to close a Contract for Difference, Switch will use reasonable endeavors to provide a quote for the Closing Price and notify you of that quote (by telephone or otherwise). It is your obligation to notify Switch as soon as possible as to whether you are willing to accept the Closing Price quote. If you accept the Closing Price quoted by Switch, the Contract for Difference, or relevant portion of the Contract for Difference, will be closed by the Authorizer on the Closing Date by issuing you with a Contract for Difference which is equal but opposite to the open Contract for Difference, or relevant portion of the Contract for Difference, to be closed.
                    <br>
                    (c) If the Underlying Security for the Contract for Difference is on terms that provide for its redemption, exchange or termination and you do not give notice to Switch of your intention to Close out the Contract for Difference or to roll it over on terms and by the time acceptable to Switch (whether or not you have any prior notice of that), you will be deemed to have given notice to Switch to Close Out that Contract for Difference at the Closing Price reasonably determined by Switch. In this case, the Authorizer will Close Out the Contract for Difference as at the time determined by Switch.
                    <br>
                    (d) At the Close of Business on the Closing Date, if there is a difference between the Closing Value and the Contract Value of the Contract for Difference (or portion of it closed under clause 7(b)) it must be accounted for in the following way:
                    <br>
                    (i) If the Closing Value is greater than the Contract Value, the Short Party must pay to the Long Party the difference; and
                    <br>
                    (ii) If the Closing Value is less than the Contract Value, the Long Party must pay to the Short Party the difference.
                    <br>
                    (e) If the issuer whose security represents the Underlying Security on which all or part of a Contract for Difference is based becomes externally administered in accordance with the meaning in the legislation, the Contract for Difference will be taken to have been Closed at that time. The Closing Price of the Contract for Difference will be determined by Switch who may consider a number of factors it deems appropriate including, for example, the last traded price of the Underlying Security.
                    <br><br>
                    (f) If the Underlying Security on which the Contract for Difference is based ceases to be listed for quotation on an Exchange, or is suspended from quotation for 5 consecutive Business Days, Switch may, in its absolute discretion, without limiting clause 7(g) elect to terminate the relevant Contract for Difference. If Switch elects to do so then:
                    <br>
                    (i) the Closing Date will be deemed to be the date which Switch determines (Early Closing Date); and<br>
                    (ii) you will be treated as having given notice under clause 7(a) on the Early Closing Date.
                    <br><br>
                    (g) If Switch determines that the Closing Value of a Contract for Difference cannot be calculated on or with effect on the Closing Date for any reason, the Closing Value will be the value determined by Switch in its sole discretion.
                    <br>
                    (h) Without limiting clause 7(g), if at any time trading in the Underlying Security on an Exchange is suspended or halted at any time, Switch will, in its absolute discretion in determining the Closing Value of a Contract for Difference, have regard to (but is not limited by) the last traded price before the suspension or halt.
                    <br>
                    (i) All calculations made by Switch in accordance with these Terms in the absence of any manifest error will be binding on you.

Switch will notify you as soon as practicable of the adjustment. In the absence of any manifest error any adjustment determined will be deemed to be conclusive and binding on you.
                    <br>
                    (b) Switch may give you an opportunity to elect to participate in an adjustment to the Contract for Difference which corresponds with the Adjustment Event, but Switch is not obliged to give you that opportunity, or give reasonable notice of it or make its terms correspond exactly with the Adjustment Event, nor is Switch obliged to accept in part or at all any election you make to participate. Any adjustment will take effect at the time determined by Switch.
                    <br>
                    (c) If the Underlying Security is subject to a take- over offer or similar event, Switch may at any time prior to the closing date of the offer provide you notice of Switch's intention to Close the Contract for Difference, in accordance with clause 7, with the Closing Price being the price notified to you by Switch.
                    <br>
                    (d) If at any time an Adjustment Event occurs and it is not reasonably practicable as determined by Switch in its absolute discretion to make an adjustment in accordance with clause 9(a) above, then without limiting 9(a) above, Switch may at any time after the Adjustment Event give you notice of Switch's intention to Close Out the Contract for Difference. If this occurs you will be taken to have been provided with Closing Notice in accordance with clause 7 above, with the Closing Price being the price notified to you by Switch.

                    (a) Finance Charges:<br>
                    (i) when you are a Long Party under a Contract for Difference, the Authorizer charges you a Finance Charge by interest payments which accrue on a daily basis and are payable to the Authorizer daily by you; and
                    <br>
                    (ii) when you are a Short Party under a Contract for Difference, you may be entitled to receive interest payments (which is a credit of a Finance Charge in your favour) which will accrue on a daily basis and are payable to you by the Authorizer daily, from the date the Contract for Difference is entered into until the Closing Date at the interest rate and on the terms referred to in accordance with clause 10(e) below.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-1">
                    (b) Each day the Authorizer will make interest payments by debiting or crediting your Account with the interest rate differential between the Finance Charges (being the amount of interest payable by you under the Finance Charges and the amount of interest payable by the Authorizer to you as a credit of Finance Charges). If you have insufficient free equity in your Account such that there is a net Finance Charge payable by you, under this clause, you acknowledge that any such amount is a debt owed by you to the Authorizer.
                    <br>
                    (c) When debiting or crediting amounts of interest to your Account, the Authorizer may charge or pay you interest at different rates, and at rates that are different from the rates which the Authorizer is charged or is paid on equivalent borrowings from its bank, or any other client or counterparty, including Hedge Counterparties.
                    <br>
                    (d) The Authorizer will retain the difference between the amount the Authorizer may charge or pay you, and the amount the Authorizer may charge or paid on equivalent or similar borrowings with its bank or counterparty.

                    <b>11. Margin Requirements</b><br><br>
                    (a) This clause 11 supplements clause 15 of the Terms and only prevails over it to the extent of any inconsistency.
                    <br>
                    (b) Prior to entering into a Contract for Difference with Switch you acknowledge that Switch requires you to pay cleared funds into the Trust Account held by the Authorizer as an Initial Margin and to maintain the minimum Margin Cover determined by Switch in its absolute discretion from time to time. The Margin Cover requirements may be determined automatically by an Online Service. The required Margin Cover may change at any time, including outside of trading hours and without prior notice to you. The amount of Initial Margin required by Switch and the time at which it is required will be at the absolute discretion of Switch. Switch is not obliged to permit any offset of any Initial Margin required by Switch.
                    <br>
                    (c) A Margin payment is credited by Switch at the time cleared funds have been received into the Trust Account held by the Authorizer or such earlier time as allowed by the Authorizer so a Margin Cover requirement or a Margin call is not satisfied until your payment is received in cleared funds into the Trust Account.
                    <br>
                    (d) You have an absolute obligation to maintain the amount of Margin Cover required by Switch from time to time, even if Switch also calls for more Margin. Your failure to maintain the required Margin Cover is automatically a Default.
                    <br>
                    (e) The Initial Margin requirement applicable in respect of any Contract for Difference may be increased by Switch in its absolute discretion in respect of the time for payment and the amount of it. In the event of such an increase Switch may require that you pay the Authorizer additional cleared funds equal to such an increase.
                    <br>
                    (f) Without affecting your obligation to maintain the required amount of Margin Cover, at any time in the discretion of Switch you may be required by Switch to pay additional Margin by paying the Authorizer cleared funds into the Trust Account.
                    <br>
                    (g) Without affecting your obligation to maintain the required amount of Margin Cover, if Switch requires additional funds from you to pay Margin (sometimes referred to as “calling for more Margin”) or making a Margin call you must pay the amount called by Switch by the time required by Switch, which could be immediately. If no time is specified, the time specified for payment of the Margin is within 24 hours of the Margin call being made, whether or not you actually receive notice of the Margin call. Failure to satisfy a Margin call will result in you being taken to be in Default under these Terms. Switch may require payment within a shorter time period (for example, without limitation, when there is Unusual Volatility).
                    <br><br>
                    (h) Your payment into a Trust Account will not satisfy your obligation to make payment to the Authorizer in cleared funds, even if the Authorizer temporarily waives reliance on this term. The payment obligation is not satisfied unless and cleared funds are received for the benefit of Switch.
                    <br>
                    (i) In all respects, time is of the essence for all of your payment obligations to Switch on behalf of the Authorizer.
                    <br>
                    (j) If Switch increases the required Margin Cover or makes a call for more Margin, you acknowledge and agree that Switch may refuse any request by you to enter into any further Contract for Difference positions until Switch has confirmed the receipt of the payment for more Margin in the form of cleared funds.
                    <br>
                    (k) Any net positive amount of Margin credited to your Account will not constitute a debt due by the Authorizer to you. Subject to you meeting all Margin Cover requirements and all Margin calls, you are entitled to be paid by the Authorizer an amount equal to the Withdrawable Funds and, on being paid, there will be a corresponding reduction in the balance of your Account.
                    <br>
                    (l) You acknowledge that your liability with respect to maintaining Margin Cover or to pay calls for more Margin (if any) is not limited to the amount you initially or later pay the Authorizer. You authorize the Authorizer to withdraw or otherwise apply funds or Financial Products held for your benefit by the Authorizer in any Account, or funds in any Trust Account, to satisfy partially or fully any liability you have to maintain Margin Cover or to pay a Margin Call.
                    <br>
                    (m) The Authorizer will have sole, absolute and unfettered discretion, as to the exercise of any power or right under this clause 11, including, without limitation, the calling of Margin.

                    (i) in accordance with clause 15 terminate these Terms;

                    (vi) satisfy obligations that you have to the Authorizer out of any property belonging to you including, money or security in the Authorizer's custody or control including, without limitation, the Trust Account or by selling securities lodged by you with the Authorizer or setting off obligations such that security transferred as collateral is not required to be returned but instead the value of them (as determined by the Authorizer) is applied in calculation of the set-off of obligations and to enforce any asset or security held by the Authorizer in such manner as it sees fit at your risk and expense;
                    <br>
                    (vii) transfer from your other accounts or the Trust Account, if any, such funds as may be required for that purpose to satisfy any obligation you may have to the Authorizer; and

Before deciding to trade, you need to ensure that you understand the risks involved and consider your investment objectives and level of experience. Seek independent advice, if necessary.<br><br>
                 Switch Markets International PTE Ltd does not issue advice, recommendations or opinions in relation to acquiring, holding or disposing of a CFD.
